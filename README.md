# Webview Advanced

Have you got any issues when you try to upload a file through a webview in Android?

There is an error when you try to upload files into a website through a simple Webview from your android device.

This code is a solution if you need to inflate a webview in order to upload a file through a inflated website.

This app is inflating [this](https://jonathanbcsouza.github.io/Advanced_WebView/) test webpage in the MainActivity but you can wrap wherever website you want.
